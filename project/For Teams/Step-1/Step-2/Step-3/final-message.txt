Back in black I hit the sack I've been too long I'm glad to be back Yes I am Let loose from the noose That's kept me hanging about I kept looking at the sky cause it's gettin' me high Forget the hearse cause I'll never die I got nine lives cat's eyes Abusin' every one of them and runnin' wild Cause I'm back Yes I'm back Well I'm back Yes I'm back Well I'm back back Well I'm back in black Yes I'm back in black Back in the back of a Cadillac Number one with a bullet I'm a power pack Yes I am In a bang with the gang They've got to catch me if they want me to hang Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack Nobody's gonna get me on another rap So look at me now I'm just makin' my play Don't try to push your luck just get out of my way Cause I'm back Yes I'm back Well I'm back Yes I'm back Well I'm back back Well I'm back in black Yes I'm back in black  Well I'm back yes I'm back Well I'm back yes I'm back Well I'm back back Well I'm back in black Yes I'm back in black  Ho yeah Oh yeah Yes I am Oh yeah, yeah oh yeah Back in now  Well I'm back, I'm back Back, (I'm back) Back, (I'm back) Back, (I'm back) Back, (I'm back) Back Back in black Yes I'm back in black  Outta sight
