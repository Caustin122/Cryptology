Can you tell me what this makes?

c=cup
oz=ounce
t=teaspoon
#=pound (NOT HASHTAG!)
~=approximately

0.5 c butter 
1 medium onion, diced 
2 cloves garlic, minced 
42 oz chicken broth (homemade, of course!)
0.25 t white pepper
0.25 t celery seed
3 to 4 medium jalapeño peppers, diced
2# Velveeta cheese, cubed 
2 c heavy cream

Sauté the onions in the butter until tender.  Add the garlic and sauté for a few more minutes until fragrant and drool inducing.  Add the chicken broth, white pepper, celery seed, and jalapeño peppers -- and simmer for ~10 min.  Lower the heat and add the Velveeta cheese in small cubes.  Stir until melted, then add the cream.  Stir frequently until slightly thickened (~15 min) and the soup just begins to boil.  Salt to taste (but you probably won't need any).  Enjoy!  Feeds about four.  Make 3 times the recipe and freeze the rest.  Thaw and enjoy as a queso dip!
